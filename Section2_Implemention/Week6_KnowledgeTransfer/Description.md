# Support, Training, and Contingency Planning

Three to five years is a long time in the IT world. What was a threat today may not be the most critical threat tomorrow? What if factors change that cause your strategic plan to change? By their very nature, strategic plans and policies do not change much; but they do need to be reviewed and either updated and certified or recertified as current. This review should be performed at least once a year and include provisions, and an action plan if items are found in non-compliance.

One strategy for clear and correct transaction processing observing policies and SOPs is to train users and ensure proper knowledge transfer. User awareness strategies comprise user documentation, newsletters, training, and conferences for policy awareness and compliance. Customer support, user support, and service management strategies must also be part of the IT solution strategy.

Technical support teams must be trained as well, and all documentation must be available to them. This includes a knowledge base with a populated database of all possible issues or failures, recorded with the cause of the incident or issue and steps to follow for resolution. As more problems are resolved, they must be inserted in the knowledge database for future reference and when updating strategic governance plans, which should be reviewed and updated at least once a year.

A knowledge database can also be made available to users, along with action steps to follow so that users can resolve certain level issues (level 1) without technical support intervention. The user- and customer-support and -management strategy must state the levels of support and steps for escalation until issue resolution. These are control tools and techniques for user reference as to how to properly use systems, applications, and request technical assistance when needed.

For your plan to be effective, you must consider how to communicate the policies to the organization. As part of the approval, deployment, and communication process to employees, users, and stakeholders, you must develop a user awareness program or update as new policies or standards are approved and published to the existing user awareness training program if one already exists. You should ask yourself these questions:

- How will you garner support from leadership?
- How will you ensure that the policies are being followed?
- Will your plan have milestones?
- How will you keep track of progress?
- Who is responsible for each step of the plan?

Issues and incidents are risks that can happen anytime. Some incidents can cause partial disruptions to operations; but others need to be reported and addressed to avoid further disruption or damage to data, systems, and overall operations. To present provisions and courses of action to mitigate the risk and resolve all problems is the reason to have alternate plans or response strategies. One of the levels for problem resolution may be resorting to activating incident management plans and contingency plans.

A contingency plan is generally created to help prepare organizations to respond to an incident, emergency, or business outage. IT departments must develop, test, and manage incident-handling strategies—starting by writing a policy followed by a procedure, where all levels of potential sources of risks are presented along with escalation processes until its resolution and return to normal operations. A disaster recovery/contingency plan must start with a policy designating authority and accountability to the disaster management team identified in the policy. They are responsible for business continuity in case of an incident or emergency, writing and updating the policy.

A contingency plan should not be a static document or strategy. Instead, it must be a living document, made official by policy, in which changes are inserted as new threats arise, or incidents are registered as part of the risk assessment and risk management process. Operations, departments, or business units must work in coordination with the IT department to develop and coordinate business continuity strategies for operations continuum during an incident, disruption of operations, or disaster.

For this week’s assignment, you must create a user-support strategy for policy and standards compliance, contingency, and incident-handling plan.

Review the resources listed below (and previously provided resources, as needed) to prepare for this week’s assignments. The resources may include textbook reading assignments, journal articles, websites, links to tools or software, videos, handouts, rubrics, etc.
