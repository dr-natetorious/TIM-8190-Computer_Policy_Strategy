# Design an IT Policy Control Framework

Every IT layer (network, operating systems, data, and application) has specific controls. For this assignment, you must design a policy and control structure, categorized by network and application layer, based upon the roadmap you created for the previous assignment.

## Define standards

Begin the assignment by creating naming standards for the following:

- Telecommunications communication policies, rules, and controls
- Network hardware devices (switches, routers, etc.) policies
- Operating systems access controls (group policies)
- Data control policies - metadata design and management (business and technical dictionary model)
- Data control policies - master data management standards
- Hierarchical Input-Output (HIPO) charts
- Application design and coding policies

## Diagram controls and policies

Diagram an IT policy control framework that categorizes each policy based on implementation. You may use a software tool, such as Visio, to create the diagram.

## Present controls to the CIO

Write a paper that presents your IT policy control framework to the CIO and stakeholders that includes or addresses the following:

- Explanation of the expected results and benefits upon implementation. What are the expected goals for the performance measures processes to be conducted in relation to policy and standards compliance?
- Presentation of a performance standard reporting system that measures how systems improve when the control structures are implemented. What system architecture and user interface (UI) design criteria would you consider when creating a KPI reporting system for policy inclusion and why?
- Recommendations for reporting tools such as business intelligence (BI) tools. BI tools provide diverse reporting tools that summarize and present data in a synthesized manner to support decision-making. Dashboards, interactive graphics or maps, and many other tools are currently popular for data reporting. What are the most suitable reporting tools to include and insert as part of the strategic IT policy implementation plan?

## Requirements

Length: 7-9 page paper, including title, reference pages, and your IT policy control framework.

References: Include a minimum of 5 scholarly references

The completed assignment should demonstrate thoughtful consideration of the ideas and concepts presented in the course by providing new thoughts and insights relating directly to this topic. The content should reflect scholarly writing and current APA standards and should adhere to Northcentral University's Academic Integrity Policy.
