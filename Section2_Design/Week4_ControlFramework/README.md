# Compliance, Quality Assurance, and Performance Management Metrics

Dr. W. Edwards Deming, Dr. Joseph Juran, and Philip Crosby, known as the quality gurus, defined quality as efficiency and effectiveness metrics used to validate whether a product, service chain, or result meets client or user expectations and is fit for use (Botezatu, Pirnau, & Carp-Ciocardia, 2019). Policies, standards, and operating procedures are tools designed to guarantee the quality of the product or service, process integrity, security, and compliance. A balance in control provisions and configurations must be reviewed and checked to avoid disrupting or limiting access to needed resources, data, and applications (the principle of availability within the security triad).

Any project or strategy must contemplate metrics and key performance indicators (KPI) for project or operations progress and performance evaluations. These metrics will serve to certify policies and standards that are operational and do not disrupt the normal state of operations. They also serve to measure completeness, correctness, and due care during configuration and management.

This week, you will continue working with your IT strategic implementation plan, this time focusing on KPIs and designing a quality testing and assurance strategy along with reporting tools like graphs, dashboards, or others. These metrics and quality standards that must be reflected in your final strategic policy and standards framework.
