# Risk and Quality Management

All IT systems administrators’ project or development team(s) must identify and target potential issues or risks proactively in order to mitigate any potential delay or flaw in coding, installation, or configurations prior to testing and implementation stage of the projects. The focus of this week is to identify and define the elements—or KPIs—a critical component that can be used to measure performance and quality levels. KPIs also serve to design testing cases for user acceptance processes, which may include controls and requirements for policy and standards compliance.

By testing and validating the right control structure and acceptable quality standards, not only would optimal performance and expected outcomes to be achieved, but also user expectations and customer satisfaction will be accomplished. Data and systems integrity will be guaranteed, as well. That is the main goal of setting policies, standards, and procedures.

Risk in IT is the probability that an event will happen that will disrupt the IT solutions development process and related projects (Kim, Mithas, & Kimbrough, 2017). This likelihood presents probabilities of delays; holes or mistakes in application development and implementation, database design, and metadata development; plus, potential harm or disruption of the normal state of product or service chain. These vulnerabilities can be avoided, detected, or controlled if developers and project team members identify them and if a proactive control structure or program is in place.

Policies, standards, and procedures must reflect the reality of operations and networking landscape installed and configured at the data center. Having excessive controls and policies will impact or delay operations, resulting in higher operating costs, inefficiency, and customer dissatisfaction with the quality of services rendered. The purpose of risk management is to assist systems administrators and management in prioritizing how to protect IT assets based on the impact the loss or failure.

A risk categorization matrix should be used to classify possible risks or vulnerabilities to avoid when writing and implementing policies, and a plan or risk-reduction strategy to mitigate and control potential exceptions as part of the policy. Sample enterprise policies related to the proper use of the IT landscape and resources are:

- Computer Use Policy
- Electronic Communications Policy
- Information Security Program Policy
- System Security Acquisition and Deployment Policy
- Data Classification and Management Policy
- Incident Response and Handling Policy
- Systems Security Management Policy
- Contingency Planning and Business Continuity Policy
- Physical Security and Asset Management Policy
- Access Control Policy
- Accounts and Password Management Policy
- Data Governance Policy
- Social Media Policy
- Enterprise and Network Architecture Policy
- Software Architecture Policy
- Review the resources listed below (and previously provided resources, as needed) to prepare for this week’s assignments. The resources may include textbook reading assignments, journal articles, websites, links to tools or software, videos, handouts, rubrics, etc.
