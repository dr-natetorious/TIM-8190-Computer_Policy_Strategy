# Present a Milestones, Benchmarks, and Deliverables Roadmap

For this assignment, you must research IT policy management and standards for IT policy creation, formulation, technical configuration, and management. Many organizations list this information and their procedures publicly on their websites, along with sample screenshots of the corresponding OS, DB, or application parameters. Some examples are listed in this week’s resources.

## Scenario

As the CIO of NCUONE Cloud Consulting Services (NCUONE-CCS), a growing organization where each department has historically created their own policies and stored them locally in their own department. Additionally, the departments have not had requirements or standard formatting for policies and standards management. Now that operations are expanding and resources are growing, a need for standardization has become critical.

You are leading a task force charged with the development of a framework for the creation, storage, approval, modification, and removal of policies in a repository. Your responsibility, as the CIO and leader with the most policy experience, is to lead enterprise policy development and management. Your team includes a representative from operational departments, a representative of management, and legal services.

## Assignment Instructions

1. Create an IT policy development, implementation, and management roadmap that includes the following:

- New process for creating, storing, approving, modifying, and retiring policies in the new repository
- Diagram or flowchart of the process in the appendix, similar to Figure 5. Use the sample roadmap provided only as a guide. Your roadmap must be clear, concise, and precise. You must create your own roadmap, images, or templates from the internet will not be accepted.
- Major milestones during the process with time estimates.
- Description of how the policies will be stored and published for viewing by employees or the public, as appropriate.
- Length: 3-5 pages

2. Develop a short PowerPoint presentation for stakeholders justifying the need to have a roadmap for policy and standard development. It must be specifically designed for your project topic, and cannot use the sample roadmap presented in this week’s introduction. Remember that your audience is executive management and VPs; therefore, the tone needs to be clear, concise, professional and balanced with technical terms. Your presentation must contain the following:

- Explanation of the steps, resources, deliverables, and milestones (roadmap).
- Images from the Internet are not acceptable.
- Use the Record Audio feature in PowerPoint to narrate your presentation.
- Length: 3-5 slides

The completed assignment should demonstrate thoughtful consideration of the ideas and concepts presented in the course by providing new thoughts and insights relating directly to this topic. The content should reflect scholarly writing and current APA standards and should adhere to Northcentral University's Academic Integrity Policy.
