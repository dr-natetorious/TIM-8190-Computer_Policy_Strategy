# Conduct a Business Needs Assignment

For this assignment, you must conduct a business needs assessment and requirements determination for your chosen organization and verbally present your findings in a video.

Conduct a business needs assessment by developing an application and data inventory repository matrix or table, similar to the ones shown below. You may use network inventory tools like Open-AudIT (open source), Manage Engine System Inventory Tool, SolarWinds, Belarc Advisor, or any other open-source tool for network and application inventory.

3. Reference to at least 3 academic sources.

Create a summary of your presentation in a separate document. Include full citations for each reference.
