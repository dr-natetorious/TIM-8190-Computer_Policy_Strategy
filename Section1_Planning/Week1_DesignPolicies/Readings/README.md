## Information technology investment governance (2015)

Ali, S., Green, P., & Robb, A. (2015). Information technology investment governance: What is it and does it matter? INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING INFORMATION SYSTEMS, 18, 1–25. [doi](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.accinf.2015.04.002). [InvestmentGovernance.pdf](InvestmentGovernance.pdf).

Businesses are making ever more significant investments into technology.  However, those systems do not always produce meaningful, sustainable, or competitive improvements.  These situations waste time and resources, and require governance processes (e.g., steering committees) to ensure the business is aquiring the right capabilities.

> IT investment governance (ITIG) which is a subset of IT governance is mainly concerned with the aspects of value delivery and resource management of IT within organizations (Weill & Ross, 2004; ITGI, 2008). Weill & Ross (2004), note that IT governance encompasses five sub-domains: IT principles; IT architecture; IT infrastructure; business application needs; and value delivery and resource management. [...] Because resource-based theory can explain the source of organizations’ sustained competitive advantage and is widely used in strategic management discipline, it has also been used by IT researchers in multiple research areas of information systems (IS) (Seddon, 2014).

## Governance of IT - Benefits of Good IT Governance (2013)

Holt, A. L. (2013). Governance of IT: An executive guide to ISO/IEC 38500. Chapter 6. London, UK: BCS. [ProQuest](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/ncent-ebooks/detail.action?docID=1213991). [GovernIT_ch6](GovernIT_ch6.pdf).

Organisations working from the 38500 six principles of best practice IT governance, and
using a tried and tested decision-making model to evaluate business cases and to guide
procurement decisions, can expect to see the following benefits:

- cost reduction;
- performance improvement;
- ability to react quickly to market changes;
- increased customer satisfaction;
- more sustainable practices;
- increased revenue per dollar cost;
- general workplace benefits for the board, management and staff.

When you look through the list of bad things that can happen when there is no or
insufficient IT governance in place, you will soon observe that these events would mostly
be linked – for example, a security breach would almost always result in a reputation
loss, and a reputation loss is likely to result in a loss of business. Loss of business will
result in financial loss.

The reason for considering these outcomes separately is to identify the different types
of governance-related root causes that can result in ‘bad things’:

- security breaches;
- financial loss;
- nasty surprises;
- general reputation loss;
- loss of business.
