## Information technology investment governance (2015)

Ali, S., Green, P., & Robb, A. (2015). Information technology investment governance: What is it and does it matter? INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING INFORMATION SYSTEMS, 18, 1–25. [doi](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.accinf.2015.04.002). [InvestmentGovernance.pdf](InvestmentGovernance.pdf).

Businesses are making ever more significant investments into technology.  However, those systems do not always produce meaningful, sustainable, or competitive improvements.  These situations waste time and resources, and require governance processes (e.g., steering committees) to ensure the business is aquiring the right capabilities.

> IT investment governance (ITIG) which is a subset of IT governance is mainly concerned with the aspects of value delivery and resource management of IT within organizations (Weill & Ross, 2004; ITGI, 2008). Weill & Ross (2004), note that IT governance encompasses five sub-domains: IT principles; IT architecture; IT infrastructure; business application needs; and value delivery and resource management. [...] Because resource-based theory can explain the source of organizations’ sustained competitive advantage and is widely used in strategic management discipline, it has also been used by IT researchers in multiple research areas of information systems (IS) (Seddon, 2014).

## Governance of IT - Benefits of Good IT Governance (2013)

Holt, A. L. (2013). Governance of IT: An executive guide to ISO/IEC 38500. Chapter 6. London, UK: BCS. [ProQuest](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/ncent-ebooks/detail.action?docID=1213991). [GovernIT_ch6](GovernIT_ch6.pdf).

Organisations working from the 38500 six principles of best practice IT governance, and
using a tried and tested decision-making model to evaluate business cases and to guide
procurement decisions, can expect to see the following benefits:

- cost reduction;
- performance improvement;
- ability to react quickly to market changes;
- increased customer satisfaction;
- more sustainable practices;
- increased revenue per dollar cost;
- general workplace benefits for the board, management and staff.

When you look through the list of bad things that can happen when there is no or
insufficient IT governance in place, you will soon observe that these events would mostly
be linked – for example, a security breach would almost always result in a reputation
loss, and a reputation loss is likely to result in a loss of business. Loss of business will
result in financial loss.

The reason for considering these outcomes separately is to identify the different types
of governance-related root causes that can result in ‘bad things’:

- security breaches;
- financial loss;
- nasty surprises;
- general reputation loss;
- loss of business.

## Strategic IT and organizational politics (2015)

Iyamu, T. (Ed.). (2015). Strategic Information Technology Governance and Organizational Politics in Modern Business. IGI Global. [doi](https://doi.org/10.4018/978-1-4666-8524-6). [IGI Global Publisher](https://www-igi-global-com.proxy1.ncu.edu/gateway/book/124236). [StrategicIT_book](StrategicIT_book.pdf).

Medium sized enterprises adopt technology without considering the broader implications.  This haphazard procurement model creates challenges integrating systems which now span different vendors and IT stacks.  The senior leadership team owns the budget, direction, and IT resource strategy.  However, those leaders are typically focused on running the business versus keeping up with the latest solutions.  Meanwhile, middle management lacks the training and experience to properly vet new patterns and paradymns.  Instead, businesses must define **Strategic Information Systems Planning** policies that align the IT direction with the business plans.

> In the last two decades, much work has been done on organisational politics, as well as on strategic information technology (IT), often separately articulated and presented. Thus, what has been missing is the interaction between strategic IT and organisational politics, making many of the major IT challenges in organisations to remain unresolved. Some of the IT challenges include how networks of both human and non-human actors are formed; how the actors’ interacts; structural diverse; and manifestation of environmental factorsin the development, implementation, management and use of information systems and technologies in the organisations. It is in this area this book focuses upon, for the benefit of both the academic and corporate domains.

### How did they study SISP

The present study included one _independent variable_: Strategic Information Systems Planning Process (SISPP) with five phases namely:

- strategic awareness,
- situation analysis,
- strategy conception,
- strategy formulation,
- and strategy implementation.

One _dependent variable_ was Strategic Information Systems Planning Success (SISPS). The SISPS contain four dimensions, namely:

- alignment,
- analysis,
- cooperation,
- and improvement in capabilities.

One _moderate variable_: environmental uncertainty with three sub-constructs, which are

- environmental dynamism (instability),
- environmental heterogeneity (diversity and complexity)
- and environmental hostility (resource availability).

### What influence comes from organizational structure

> Organisational structure is a `fundamental factor influencing SISP effectiveness and strategic information systems applications` (Wang & Tai, 2003). Organisational structure refers to the framework typically hierarchical within which an organisation arranges its lines of authority and communications, and allocates rights and duties. Organisational structure determines the manner and extent to which roles, power and responsibilities are delegated, controlled and coordinated, and how information flows between levels of management. `A structure depends entirely on the organisation’s objectives and the strategy chosen to achieve them` (Morton & Hu, 2008; Lee & Pai, 2003).
>
>According to Donaldson (2001) organisational structure is `more complicated than distinguishing between centralised and decentralised operations or decisions-making`. Other commonly cited structural dimensions include specialisation, standardisation, formalisation, hierarchical levels and span of control. Taking into account of the number of proposed structural dimensions and the variety of their definitions, `identifying a definitive set of organisational dimensions is difficult without specific context and objectives` (Morton & Hu, 2008).

## What is IT governance (2017)

Lindros, K. (2017, July 31). What is IT governance? A formal way to align IT & business strategy. [cio.com](https://www.cio.com/article/2438931/governanceit-governance-definition-and-solutions.html). [CIO_Governance](CIO_Governance.pdf). [YouTube](https://youtu.be/5U5f17vO1Y0).

The most commonly used frameworks are:

- **COBIT**: Published by ISACA, COBIT is a comprehensive framework of "globally accepted practices, analytical tools and models" (PDF) designed for governance and management of enterprise IT. With its roots in IT auditing, ISACA expanded COBIT's scope over the years to fully support IT governance. The latest version is COBIT 5, which is widely used by organizations focused on risk management and mitigation.

- **ITIL**: Formerly an acronym for Information Technology Infrastructure Library, ITIL focuses on IT service management. It aims to ensure that IT services support core processes of the business. ITIL comprises five sets of management best practices for service strategy, design, transition (such as change management), operation and continual service improvement.

- **COSO**: This model for evaluating internal controls is from the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). COSO's focus is less IT-specific than the other frameworks, concentrating more on business aspects like enterprise risk management (ERM) and fraud deterrence.

- **CMMI**: The Capability Maturity Model Integration method, developed by the Software Engineering Institute, is an approach to performance improvement. CMMI uses a scale of 1 to 5 to gauge an organization's performance, quality and profitability maturity level. According to Calatayud, "allowing for mixed mode and objective measurements to be inserted is critical in measuring risks that are qualitative in nature."

- **FAIR**: Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) is a relatively new model that helps organizations quantify risk. The focus is on cyber security and operational risk, with the goal of making more well-informed decisions. Although it's newer than other frameworks mentioned here, Calatayud points out that it's already gained a lot of traction with Fortune 500 companies.
