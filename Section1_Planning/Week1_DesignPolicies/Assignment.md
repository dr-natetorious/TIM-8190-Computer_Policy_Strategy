# Recommend a Policy Strategy

For the first assignment of the course, you must present a proposal for the review, update, or development of an internal IT policy strategy for your organization.

1. Begin by choosing an organization you are familiar with, such as a current or past place of employment, to recommend changes to their current policy strategies; you can change the name of the organization to keep it anonymous. If you do not have IT organizational experience to draw upon, use the NCUONE Cloud Consulting Services (NCUONE-CCS) organization in the case study included in this week’s resources.

2. Create a technical paper with an executive summary that includes the following:

- Description of the selected company and summary of the nature and method of operations, supply, or service chain.
- Definition of the mission, vision, and strategic goals.
- Information regarding the importance of aligning a company’s mission and vision with strategic policies and standards for IT solutions planning and implementation.

3. Review of the IT landscape, composed of telecommunications and network infrastructure, databases or data warehouse, and applications.
Add an analysis of several potential internal IT policies based on the current IT landscape to the paper. Be sure to cover operational, data, and application parameters and controls.

4. Conclude the paper with a recommendation for an IT policy strategy that meets the needs of your selected organization.
