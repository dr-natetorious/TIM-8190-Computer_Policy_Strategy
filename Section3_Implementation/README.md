# IT Policy and Procedures Implementation

A strategy is a high-level document or plan that must reflect the control and parameter settings configured in operating systems, network appliances, databases, and applications. They must be approved and funded by executive management or board of directors before being deployed or executed. The strategy to be proposed must meet the highest professional standards, be precise and concise but complete, and be presented in a cohesive and logical manner to achieve the first goal of any project or strategic planning process: to get management’s approval and support.

IT technical implementation plans differ from traditional strategic plans because they include technical design and specifications. These plans include provisions for network, data, and applications models, workflows and coding specifications—among other content elements and assessment control criteria.

During the last two weeks of this final course, you will consolidate all previous assignments and customize them into a formal, technical, strategic plan for your proposed IT implementation solution. Once the plan is completed, you will create a high-level presentation to be delivered to executive management for approval. See the Strategic Plan Checklist in your Week 7 resources.
