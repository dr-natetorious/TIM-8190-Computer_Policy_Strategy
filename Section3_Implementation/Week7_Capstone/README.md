# Implementation Planning

This week, you will develop your strategic policy enterprise portfolio, based on your roadmap and outlines developed towards developing the final strategic standards and policies, both written, and systems configurations and parameters aligned to these written policies.

Strategic plans are executive documents that need to be reviewed and approved by executive management—or designated committees (e.g., an IT steering committee). Once approved, the contents of these documents need to be deployed, documented, plus any related projects authorized and launched.

Organizations are aware of the growing dependency on IT for operations and supply chain and are continually looking for opportunities to improve. IT plays a key role but is mostly a cost center with no specific metrics for return on investment (ROI), which is why it is important to carefully draft a balanced budget and manage it as part of the project portfolio (Jafari, 2014). As operations are expanded at a broader geographical scope, even overseas, IT management must make sure all resources needed for all planned implementation and developments are available. With these perspectives, policies, standards, and procedures must be as concise and precise as possible.

This week, you will review all previous assignments along with feedback provided by your professor and start working with the Signature Assignment of this course, the IT implementation strategic plan. You will format the final document, with the specific format, now inserting the table of contents, cover page, ensuring all citations are presented in observance of APA standards, and any additional reference or annexures applicable.

Review the resources listed below (and previously provided resources, as needed) to prepare for this week’s assignments. The resources may include textbook reading assignments, journal articles, websites, links to tools or software, videos, handouts, rubrics, etc.
